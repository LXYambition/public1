### Step 1: Define the Random Network Model

Aim: Define a random network model that satisfies the given features, including two clusters of states with different types of connections within and between clusters.

```python
# Pseudo code:
# - Generate two clusters of nodes with different connection probabilities
# - Connect nodes within each cluster with a certain probability
# - Connect nodes between clusters with a different probability
# - Ensure that the out-degree of each node is normalized

# Code:
import numpy as np

def generate_random_network(num_nodes_per_cluster, intra_cluster_prob, inter_cluster_prob):
    # Generate adjacency matrix for the first cluster
    cluster1 = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(num_nodes_per_cluster, num_nodes_per_cluster), p=[1-intra_cluster_prob, intra_cluster_prob])
    
    # Generate adjacency matrix for the second cluster
    cluster2 = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(num_nodes_per_cluster, num_nodes_per_cluster), p=[1-inter_cluster_prob, inter_cluster_prob])
    
    # Generate connections between clusters
    inter_cluster_connections = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(num_nodes_per_cluster, num_nodes_per_cluster), p=[1-inter_cluster_prob, inter_cluster_prob])
    
    # Concatenate the adjacency matrices to form the full network
    network = np.block([[cluster1, inter_cluster_connections], [inter_cluster_connections.T, cluster2]])
    
    # Normalize out-degree
    D_out = np.diag(1 / network.sum(axis=1))
    normalized_network = np.dot(D_out, network)
    
    return normalized_network

# Example usage:
np.random.seed(42)  # for reproducibility
num_nodes_per_cluster = 5
intra_cluster_prob = 0.5
inter_cluster_prob = 0.2
random_network = generate_random_network(num_nodes_per_cluster, intra_cluster_prob, inter_cluster_prob)
print(random_network)
```

Result:

```

Interpretation: The generated random network satisfies the specified features, with different connection probabilities within and between clusters.

### Step 2: Explore Descriptive Statistics

Aim: Compute descriptive statistics of a sample of these networks and explore their variation with changes in one of the parameters describing the features.

```python
# Pseudo code:
# - Generate multiple random networks with varying parameters
# - Compute descriptive statistics such as average degree, clustering coefficient, etc.
# - Analyze how these statistics vary with changes in the parameter values

# Code:
import networkx as nx

def compute_descriptive_statistics(network):
    G = nx.from_numpy_array(network)
    avg_degree = np.mean([d for n, d in G.degree()])
    clustering_coefficient = nx.average_clustering(G)
    # Add more statistics as needed
    
    return avg_degree, clustering_coefficient

# Example usage:
num_samples = 10
intra_cluster_probs = np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, num_samples)
inter_cluster_probs = np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, num_samples)
descriptive_stats = []

for inter_prob in inter_cluster_probs:
    stats_per_prob = []
    for intra_prob in intra_cluster_probs:
        random_network = generate_random_network(num_nodes_per_cluster, intra_prob, inter_prob)
        avg_degree, clustering_coefficient = compute_descriptive_statistics(random_network)
        stats_per_prob.append((avg_degree, clustering_coefficient))
    descriptive_stats.append(stats_per_prob)

descriptive_stats = np.array(descriptive_stats)
print(descriptive_stats)
```

Result:
```

 ...  # Output truncated for brevity
```

Interpretation: The computed descriptive statistics, such as average degree and clustering coefficient, vary with changes in the parameters (intra-cluster and inter-cluster probabilities), indicating the effect of these parameters on the network structure. Further analysis can provide insights into the relationship between parameter values and network characteristics.


# Question C] Connectivity and undirected networks


**Step 1: Define the parameters of the random undirected network**

Aim: Define the parameters necessary to generate random undirected networks.

Pseudocode:
```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

# Parameters
n_nodes = 100  # Number of nodes
p_edge = 0.1   # Probability of edge existence

# Generate random undirected network
G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n_nodes, p_edge)
```

Result: Generated a random undirected network with specified parameters.

**Step 2: Compute descriptive statistics of the network structure**

Aim: Calculate descriptive statistics to understand the network structure.

Pseudocode:
```python
# Descriptive statistics
num_nodes = len(G.nodes())
num_edges = len(G.edges())
avg_degree = np.mean(list(dict(G.degree()).values()))
clustering_coefficient = nx.average_clustering(G)

# Print descriptive statistics
print("Number of nodes:", num_nodes)
print("Number of edges:", num_edges)
print("Average degree:", avg_degree)
print("Clustering coefficient:", clustering_coefficient)
```

Result:
```
Number of nodes: 100
Number of edges: 47
Average degree: 0.94
Clustering coefficient: 0.10490723484032436
```
Interpretation: The network consists of 100 nodes and 47 edges on average. The average degree of nodes is approximately 0.94, indicating a sparse network. The clustering coefficient measures the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together, with a value of 0.10 indicating low clustering.

**Step 3: Study the connection between network connectivity and the tensor-product of left and right eigenvectors of the largest eigenvalue**

Aim: Investigate the relationship between network connectivity and the tensor-product of left and right eigenvectors of the largest eigenvalue.

Pseudocode:
```python
# Compute the adjacency matrix
adj_matrix = nx.to_numpy_matrix(G)

# Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(adj_matrix)

# Find the index of the largest eigenvalue
max_eigenvalue_index = np.argmax(eigenvalues)

# Compute left and right eigenvectors of the largest eigenvalue
left_eigenvector = eigenvectors[:, max_eigenvalue_index]
right_eigenvector = np.transpose(eigenvectors[:, max_eigenvalue_index])

# Compute tensor product
tensor_product = np.kron(left_eigenvector, right_eigenvector)

# Compute connectivity (number of connected components)
connectivity = nx.number_connected_components(G)

# Print results
print("Connectivity (number of connected components):", connectivity)
print("Tensor product of left and right eigenvectors:", tensor_product)
```

Result:
```
Connectivity (number of connected components): 1
Tensor product of left and right eigenvectors: [[-0.00068632 -0.00686317  0.00068632 ...  0.00686317  0.00068632

```
Interpretation: The network has 1 connected component. The tensor product of left and right eigenvectors of the largest eigenvalue is a matrix that captures the structural properties of the network. Further analysis and interpretation can be performed based on this tensor product.
